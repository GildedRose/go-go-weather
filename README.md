# Go-Go Weather Dashboard
This project is a weather dashboard that pulls current and forecasted weather conditions for searched for cities.

##Motivation
The Go-Go Weather Dashboard was a Week 6 project at UTAustin Full Stack Development Boot Camp. This project asked students to fetch specific information from the OpenWeather API and store presistent data in localStorage.

## Deployed URL: https://gildedrose.github.io/go-go-weather/

## Ticket:
AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly.
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index
WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city.

## How-to use:
User will input city name into the search bar. Upon hitting enter, current date and weather will be displayed, along with a 5 day forecast. The searched for city will be stored in localStorage, and displayed in "Search History." Upon page refresh, previous searched cities that have been stored in localStorage will appear in Search History.
